## Canopact

### Getting Started

Clone the repo, then open up a terminal and cd into the root directory. Once in the directory, run the below commands: 

```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

Once finished, press ctrl+c a few times and then run the below command in
your terminal:

```sh
docker-compose down
```

You don't need to build everytime, when booting up the web app again you can simply run: 

```sh
docker-compose up
```
